## Pipeline to extract comparable corpus from comparable corpora

Current setup: assumed for every source sentence, a respectable size of candidate list is available.

Use comparable-corpora.ipynb to follow the pipeline to find the best candidates given an MT output and script to calcualte the F-score


### To-do:
* Have relative paths with sample files of gold, trian, MT, etc.
* Make preprcessed data and MT model available
* Add filtering scripts to find candidate list using mulitlingual sentence embeddings
